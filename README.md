Kamcord Android Framework
=========================

<h3>The documentation can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/kamcord/kamcord-android-sdk/wiki">wiki</a>.</h3>

This repository contains a build of Kamcord for integrating into a Unity 4.2+ game or a generic Android project. The current version is 1.4.0. Please visit the <a href="https://github.com/kamcord/kamcord-android-sdk/wiki/Change-log">Change Log</a> to see a history of changes.

If you're using Unity, use the Unity package at `unity/Kamcord.unitypackage`.

If you'd like to integrate into an Android project not coming from Unity, the directory `android/project_skeleton` contains all the files you need.  You can find <a href = "https://github.com/kamcord/kamcord-android-sdk/wiki/Integrating-into-an-Android-Project">instructions for integrating</a> on the wiki.

Note that the `Kamcord.unitypackage` in this repository contains a complete copy of the Kamcord iOS Unity plugin, making it safe to import into existing Unity projects that use the Kamcord iOS Unity plugin. More information about the iOS plugin can be found at this repository: <a href="https://github.com/kamcord/Unity-Kamcord">https://github.com/kamcord/Unity-Kamcord</a>.
